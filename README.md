# Project Labyrinth
Create a project which allows a user to navigate a maze, in the form of a text-based adventure, provided by a backend api.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

 Started by planning the project structure with Figma. Knowing the game road-map posted by a fellow student made us gain time. We used Postman to see what data we were receiving and what to post, in order to build the fetch. We had an idea of how we wanted the game look, googling other text based games and proceeded to the styling.
 Tehcnlogies used: Figma, Postman, VS Code, Npm,
 If we had more time we would implemnet a go back button and a visual presentation of the maze map.
